## Promise/es6
[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
<br><br>

This `Promise` case is implemented in `es6`, and it is compatible with the native `async/await` function through the official unit test of the promise. This case is for study only, if it is used in a production environment, you can use the files in the `dist` directory.

### test
You can use `npm i` or `yarn` install dependencies, then use `npm run test` or `yarn test` to test.
