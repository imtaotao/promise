## Promise/es6

This `Promise` case is implemented in `es6`, and it is compatible with the native `async/await` function through the official unit test of the promise. This case is for study only, if it is used in a production environment, it needs to be compiled into `es5 code`.

### test
You can use `npm i` or `yarn` install dependencies, then use `npm run test` or `yarn test` to test.
